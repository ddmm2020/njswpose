Installation
-----

```bash
pip install njswpose
or 
# If you have changed your mirror source. You should try the following command.
pip install njswpose -i https://www.pypi.org/simple/
```

Example
-----

```bash
    from PIL import Image
    import PIL
    from torchvision.transforms import transforms
    from njswpose import pose_detection
    
    image = Image.open('./test.jpg').convert('RGB')
    loader = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToTensor()])
    image = loader(image)
    
    # The test results are saved as ./pose.jpg
    # pose_detection(image, detect_threshold=0.55, vis=True)
    keypoints,kp_score = pose_detection(image, detect_threshold=0.55, vis=True)
```
